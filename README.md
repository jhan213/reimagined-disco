## Description
The application displays a music quiz where users can test their knowledge on music from different eras: 80's, 90's, 00's, and Current Hits. Each question displays an image of the song or album and has a link to play a sample of song. Questions range from asking about the song's name, its artist's name, its album's name, and the year the song came out. 

The questions and songs are generated from Spotify API-gathered JSON files. The styling uses Tailwind CSS and the backend is Javascript and JQuery.
